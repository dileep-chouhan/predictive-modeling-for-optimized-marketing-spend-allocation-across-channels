# Predictive Modeling for Optimized Marketing Spend Allocation Across Channels

**Overview:**

This project analyzes historical marketing campaign performance data to develop a predictive model for optimizing marketing spend allocation across different channels. The goal is to identify the most cost-effective channels for maximizing customer acquisition and return on investment (ROI).  The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation to determine the optimal channel allocation strategy.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings from the analysis to the console, including:

* Summary statistics of the marketing campaign data.
* Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROI).
* Recommendations for optimized marketing spend allocation across channels.

Additionally, the script will generate the following visualization files in the `output` directory:

* `channel_performance.png`: A visualization comparing the performance of different marketing channels.
* `roi_prediction.png`: A visualization of predicted ROI based on different spend allocations.
* (Add any other generated files here)

**Data:**

The project requires a dataset containing historical marketing campaign data.  This dataset should include information such as channel, spend, customer acquisition cost (CAC), and revenue generated.  Please ensure that you have the necessary data file in the correct location specified within the `main.py` script.  (Consider adding details on data format).


**Further Development:**

Future improvements could include incorporating more sophisticated modeling techniques,  handling missing data more robustly, and adding a user interface for easier interaction with the model.  Contributions are welcome!
